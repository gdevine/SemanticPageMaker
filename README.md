SemanticPageMaker
============

The SemanticPageMaker is an application that allows for the creation of 'Linked Data'-populated web pages to describe any chosen entity. Web forms are constructed from a pre-defined set of re-usable semantic tags which, when completed, automatically produce RDFa-enabled HTML and a corresponding JSON-LD document. The application thus allows semantically-rich 
information to be collected and exposed by users with little or no knowledge of semantic web terms.
